# hello-world
This is my basic repository to test out github features n stuff.

About me:
I am an economics student who has decided to get with the times and learn R and Python for data evaluation and other purposes.
Github gives me an opportunity to store my code and share it with friends/colleagues/lecturers/recruiters and everybody else.

MfG,
Mr.B.
